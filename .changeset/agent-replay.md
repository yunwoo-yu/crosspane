Screen recording, as an opt-in plugin. `@crosspane/agent-replay` records the DOM with rrweb and rides the core agent's existing session timeline, so screen frames stay ordered alongside console and network events and land in `.crosspane.json` exports. The dashboard gains a **Screen** tab that plays them back, loading the player lazily so nobody pays for it unless a session actually has a recording.

It is a separate package because rrweb is tens of times larger than the core agent — the "no third-party dependencies, a few KB" promise of `@crosspane/agent` stays intact. The core gains one small extension point (`agent.emit`) and the protocol a generic `screen` event whose `format` field leaves room for non-rrweb capture methods later.
